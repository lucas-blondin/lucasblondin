                    <h2>The Rite of Spring</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I have been struck by the beauty and force of the reinterpretation by Pina bausch of "Le sacre du printemps" (The Rite of Spring) from the work of the russian composer Igor Stravinsky.<br><br>
                        The ballet in its contemporary form has been rendered to a simple dirt covered stage with two often rival groups; men and women.<br><br>

                        These two groups will clash and bond throughtout the piece, celebrating the return of spring until the choosing of a young woman to sacriface herself by dancing to death in a pagan ritual.
